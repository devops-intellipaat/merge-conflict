You work for Zendrix Software & Co. You have been assigned the task of updating 
the Master branch of their Git repository with all the features from the feature 
branches. 
Following is the GitHub account, https://github.com/devops-intellipaat/merge-conflict.git
Consider, 
• Feature1 branch to be a public branch 
• Feature2 branch to be a private branch 
The company relies on a monolithic architecture, and for now all the code resides in one file 
“main.c”.
The respective features have been added in the feature branches for main.c. 
Meanwhile, a security patch was made to the master branch, and now feature1 and 
feature2 branches are behind from master by 1 commit. 
Following tasks have to be done: 
1. Update Feature1 and Feature2 branch with the Security Patch 
2. Apply changes of Feature1 and Feature2 branch on master 
3. Finally push all the branches to GitHub
